The hdf Roll provides libraries for the hdf4 and hdf5 on a Rocks cluster.
The packaged software is installed in /opt/hdf4 and /opt/hdf5 on both server
and client nodes.  If the intel and/or pgi compiler rolls are present,
libraries built with those compilers are installed alongside the standard
libraries built with the gnu compilers.
